SpeedHack 2011 - LightRacer
game by Mark Oates

LightRacer is a face-paced racing game where you must advance through all 6 courses to win.

(An optional zip file was included that includes music.)

Genre requirements: E for Everyone
Games can be rated E without having to be cutesy.  I wanted to deliberately avoid making something that felt childish but still be enjoyable to everybody, hopefully this game does just that.

Technical Requirements: Random Playing
No two games are the same.  Each course you play is randomly generated before you start, but remains the same until you either complete it or lose the game.  Even though it's random, there is an incremental difficulty curve throughout the 6 courses.  In addition to the shape of the course, the rail colors are randomly placed as well, while still maintaining the difficulty curve throughout the whole game.

Technical Requirements: Laziness
If a player dies in a track, that "trouble spot" segment is cleared from its damaging state and is made neutral.  These changes remain until the player either completes the track or loses the game.

Artistic Requirements: Brainwashing Propaganda
You like open source don't you?  Of course you do...

Artistic Requirements: Color Symbolism
Each segment of a track has a specific color railing - yellow for a normal (you take some damage), blue for bouncy (throws you around, deals no damage), green (gives you health), red (take heavy damage), and flashing-red (instant death).   There is also gray (a disabled trouble spot), and disco (you're about to finish a lap).

Optional Bonus Rule: Act of Chameleon
I did not use this safety net. ;)
